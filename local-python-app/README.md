## Local Python application
This directory contains old Python code used to create a virtual environment and parse CSV files.

HTML graphs were created using the Plotly Python module.

Editing the CSV files directly was the only way to perform CRUD operations on the data, which was cumbersome and not intuitive.

Therefor a separated frontend PWA (Progressive Web Application) was created to improve upon this.
